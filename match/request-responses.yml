              Hi <name>,

              Thanks for reaching out to me. 

              I'm happy to offer training on up-to-date WordPress websites, but I need to have a look at the dashboard of the website in advance of the training. The reason being is that if the website is using an out-of-date version of WordPress or if the theme is older or not updated, it would take considerable time for me to get up to speed on it in order to offer you any usable training. 

              Once I have a look at the inside of the site, I would be able to see what options are available in the theme to perform the actions you want. Keep in mind that your theme may not offer the specific capabilities built in. You may need to install other plugins to get the capability you want. 

              You can purchase training support on my website with [this training product](https://capwebsolutions.com/shop/personalized-1-on-1-wordpress-training/). Since I have not worked on your website previously, I will need a 2 hour minimum purchase to have enough time to get into your website dashboard, see what the condition of the site is, review your task requests and prepare to walk you through the process of making those changes. If we do not get through the entire list of items in the initial period, you can purchase additional time in 1 hour increments. 

              If you want my help in getting these tasks completed, I offer a [WordPress Website Evaluation service](https://capwebsolutions.com/shop/wordpress-website-evaluation/). This service includes a full report on what's going on in your site as well as 2 hour of professional services to address the tasks you have highlighted in your email. If I am not able to complete all of the tasks in the alloted time, you can purchase additional time in 1 hour increments as above using [my troubleshooting service](https://capwebsolutions.com/shop/wordpress-troubleshooting/).    

              Let me know how you would like to proceed with this. If you wish, I'm happy to jump on a quick call to talk about it. [Use this link to schedule a short call.](https://capwebsolutions.com/go/schedule-short-call/)

              Thanks,
              Matt
