# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
# matches:
#   # Simple text replacement
#   - trigger: ":espanso"
#     replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # And much more! For more information, visit the docs: https://espanso.org/docs/
matches:
  # My fav color hex colr - Charter Blue #546E91
  - trigger: ";chart"
    replace: "546E91"

  - trigger: ";changelog"
    replace: |
